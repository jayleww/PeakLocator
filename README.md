# PeakLocator
Matlab peak finder

Uploading Matlab peak finder code for better version control. 

This code interacts with EPICS and will monitor/plot two provided PVs until told otherwise. Once finished, data will be displayed. Originally this was planned to be used to fit Gaussian curves to peaks seen in beam current during a magnet scan as beam passes through a stripping foil. By highlighting data and fitting, the magnetic field corresponding to the highest beam current could be found.
